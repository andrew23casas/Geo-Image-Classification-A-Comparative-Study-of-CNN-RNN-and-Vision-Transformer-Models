# Geo-Image-Classification-A-Comparative-Study-of-CNN-RNN-and-Vision-Transformer-Models
 This project compares CNN + MLP, CNN + RNN + MLP, and ViT + MLP architectures for determining a given image's country of origin. We use a labeled dataset from 19 countries and analyze the performance of each model. Explore the repository for code, visualizations, and findings.

## Overview
The repository is organized as follows:

code/: Contains the code for each architecture (CNN + MLP, CNN + RNN + MLP, and ViT + MLP).
paper/: Contains the final report explaining the methodologies, experiments, and results of this project
