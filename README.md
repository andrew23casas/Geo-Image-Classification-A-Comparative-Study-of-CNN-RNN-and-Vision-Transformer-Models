# Geo-Image-Classification-A-Comparative-Study-of-CNN-RNN-and-Vision-Transformer-Models
 This project compares CNN + MLP, CNN + RNN + MLP, and ViT + MLP architectures for determining a given image's country of origin. We use a labeled dataset from 19 countries and analyze the performance of each model. Explore the repository for code, visualizations, and findings.

## Overview
The repository is organized as follows:

code/: Contains the code for each architecture (CNN + MLP, CNN + RNN + MLP, and ViT + MLP).               
paper/: Contains the final report explaining the methodologies, experiments, and results of this project

## Data and Models
All supporting data and models are available in this shared Google Drive folder; they can be run on Colab as-is since there is code to download the appropriate dependencies and data: [Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gZXBbljkFpQC2NJNcN7riYN4mtx6ZpFR)
